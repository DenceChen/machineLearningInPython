"""
Sarsa is a online updating method for Reinforcement learning.

Unlike Q learning which is a offline updating method, Sarsa is updating while in the current trajectory.

You will see the sarsa is more coward when punishment is close because it cares about all behaviours,
while q learning is more brave because it only cares about maximum behaviour.
